# Trade Log

Append-only ledger of every paper trade and every EOD portfolio snapshot.
Day-over-day P&L math depends on the most recent EOD snapshot in this file.

Format has two kinds of entries:
1. **Trade entries** — one per buy/sell. Full thesis + fill details.
2. **EOD snapshots** — one per trading day. Equity + open-positions table.

## Day 0 — Pre-launch baseline snapshot

**Equity:** ₹5,00,000.00 | **Cash:** ₹5,00,000.00 (100%) | **Deployed:** 0%  
**Day P&L:** ₹0 (0.00%) | **Nifty 50 day:** N/A | **Alpha today:** N/A  
**Phase P&L:** ₹0 (0.00% from ₹5,00,000 start)

**Open positions:** none.

**Notes:** Seed state. Paper trading launches on the next pre-market routine firing.
The agent must treat this as "yesterday's equity" for its first day-over-day calculation.

## 2026-06-22 — EOD Snapshot

**Equity:** ₹5,00,000.00 | **Cash:** ₹5,00,000.00 (100%) | **Deployed:** 0%
**Day P&L:** ₹0 (0.00%) | **Nifty 50 day:** +0.38% | **Alpha today:** -0.38%
**Phase P&L:** ₹0 (0.00% from ₹5,00,000 start)

**Open positions:** none.

**Trades today:** none. Pre-market routine did not fire today (last journal entry 2026-06-18).

**Notes:** First live EOD snapshot. Book sat in 100% cash through a +0.38% Nifty 50 / +0.61% Bank Nifty session — opportunity-cost drag of -₹1,900 vs a fully-deployed index proxy, but consistent with STRATEGY.md (no candidate has cleared all gates since launch). ADANIPOWER remains the only live pullback setup flagged 2026-06-18; sector confirm and live pullback zone need re-checking in tomorrow's pre-market. UNIVERSE.md is 47 days stale — rebuild is overdue and is the single biggest process risk going into the next entry decision.

## 2026-07-01 — EOD Snapshot

**Equity:** ₹5,00,000.00 | **Cash:** ₹5,00,000.00 (100%) | **Deployed:** 0%
**Day P&L:** ₹0 (0.00%) | **Nifty 50 day:** -0.34% | **Alpha today:** +0.34%
**Phase P&L:** ₹0 (0.00% from ₹5,00,000 start)

**Open positions:** none.

**Trades today:** none. Pre-market routine did not fire today (last journal entry 2026-06-29 pre-market).

**Notes:** Book sat in 100% cash through a -0.34% Nifty 50 session (close 23,865.75, prev 23,946.25) — cash-hold outperformed a long-index proxy by ~₹1,700 on the day. Bank Nifty close not cleanly sourceable at EOD. Nine calendar days (7 trading sessions) since last EOD snapshot; pre-market/EOD routines have been intermittent. Zero entries because (a) 2026-06-29 pre-market found no PEAD candidates and (b) the data-feed outage flagged that day (`nse.sh quote` returning all-null JSON, Yahoo history HTTP 429 across retries) remains the top operational risk — no momentum gates can be evaluated until it clears. UNIVERSE.md is now 56 days stale (last rebuild 2026-05-06); rebuild is blocked on the same feed. ADANIPOWER is still the only live pullback setup from prior cycles — cannot revalidate without feeds. Priority into tomorrow's pre-market: restore `nse.sh quote` + `nse.sh history`, then run `rebuild-universe`, THEN evaluate ADANIPOWER. Absent any of those, HOLD stays the default.
