# Trade Log

Append-only ledger of every paper trade and every EOD portfolio snapshot.
Day-over-day P&L math depends on the most recent EOD snapshot in this file.

Format has two kinds of entries:
1. **Trade entries** — one per buy/sell. Full thesis + fill details.
2. **EOD snapshots** — one per trading day. Equity + open-positions table.

## 2026-06-22 — EOD Snapshot

**Equity:** ₹5,00,000.00 | **Cash:** ₹5,00,000.00 (100%) | **Deployed:** 0%
**Day P&L:** ₹0 (0.00%) | **Nifty 50 day:** +0.38% | **Alpha today:** -0.38%
**Phase P&L:** ₹0 (0.00% from ₹5,00,000 start)

**Open positions:** none.

**Trades today:** none. Pre-market routine did not fire today (last journal entry 2026-06-18).

**Notes:** First live EOD snapshot. Book sat in 100% cash through a +0.38% Nifty 50 / +0.61% Bank Nifty session — opportunity-cost drag of -₹1,900 vs a fully-deployed index proxy, but consistent with STRATEGY.md (no candidate has cleared all gates since launch). ADANIPOWER remains the only live pullback setup flagged 2026-06-18; sector confirm and live pullback zone need re-checking in tomorrow's pre-market. UNIVERSE.md is 47 days stale — rebuild is overdue and is the single biggest process risk going into the next entry decision.
