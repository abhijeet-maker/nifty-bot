# Trade Log

Append-only ledger of every paper trade and every EOD portfolio snapshot.
Day-over-day P&L math depends on the most recent EOD snapshot in this file.

Format has two kinds of entries:
1. **Trade entries** — one per buy/sell. Full thesis + fill details.
2. **EOD snapshots** — one per trading day. Equity + open-positions table.

**Notes:** 100% cash through a -1.2% Nifty 50 down day → +1.2% alpha by absence. No entry triggers fired in pre-market scans across the prior cycles (last journal entry 2026-05-22). Universe rebuild + VEDL DMA-divergence reconciliation still outstanding from the 2026-05-22 weekly-review TODO. Tomorrow: re-run pre-market scan, prioritize universe refresh if not done.
