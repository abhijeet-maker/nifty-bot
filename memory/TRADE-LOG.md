# Trade Log

Append-only ledger of every paper trade and every EOD portfolio snapshot.
Day-over-day P&L math depends on the most recent EOD snapshot in this file.

Format has two kinds of entries:
1. **Trade entries** — one per buy/sell. Full thesis + fill details.
2. **EOD snapshots** — one per trading day. Equity + open-positions table.

**Equity:** ₹5,00,000.00 | **Cash:** ₹5,00,000.00 (100%) | **Deployed:** 0%  
**Day P&L:** ₹0 (0.00%) | **Nifty 50 day:** N/A | **Alpha today:** N/A  
**Phase P&L:** ₹0 (0.00% from ₹5,00,000 start)

**Open positions:** none.

**Notes:** Seed state. Paper trading launches on the next pre-market routine firing.
The agent must treat this as "yesterday's equity" for its first day-over-day calculation.

## 2026-06-22 — EOD Snapshot

**Equity:** ₹5,00,000.00 | **Cash:** ₹5,00,000.00 (100%) | **Deployed:** 0%
**Day P&L:** ₹0 (0.00%) | **Nifty 50 day:** +0.38% | **Alpha today:** -0.38%
**Phase P&L:** ₹0 (0.00% from ₹5,00,000 start)

**Open positions:** none.

**Trades today:** none. Pre-market routine did not fire today (last journal entry 2026-06-18).

**Notes:** First live EOD snapshot. Book sat in 100% cash through a +0.38% Nifty 50 / +0.61% Bank Nifty session — opportunity-cost drag of -₹1,900 vs a fully-deployed index proxy, but consistent with STRATEGY.md (no candidate has cleared all gates since launch). ADANIPOWER remains the only live pullback setup flagged 2026-06-18; sector confirm and live pullback zone need re-checking in tomorrow's pre-market. UNIVERSE.md is 47 days stale — rebuild is overdue and is the single biggest process risk going into the next entry decision.

## 2026-06-26 — EOD Snapshot

**Equity:** ₹5,00,000.00 | **Cash:** ₹5,00,000.00 (100%) | **Deployed:** 0%
**Day P&L:** ₹0 (0.00%) | **Nifty 50 day:** +0.14% | **Alpha today:** -0.14%
**Phase P&L:** ₹0 (0.00% from ₹5,00,000 start)

**Open positions:** none.

**Trades today:** none. Pre-market routine did not fire today; no journal entries between 2026-06-22 EOD and now. Tue/Wed/Thu of this week also silent — 3 consecutive missed pre-market windows.

**Notes:** Cash-drag week. Nifty 50 +0.14% today (24,021.65 → 24,056.00); Bank Nifty prev close 58,177 (+0.05% on Jun 25, today not yet ranged in source). Cumulative drag since launch remains small (low single-digit basis points) because index returns have been modest. Two compounding process risks now: (1) UNIVERSE.md is 51 days stale (last rebuild 2026-05-06) — every entry decision is keying off out-of-date rankings, and VEDL is still falsely #1 due to unadjusted corporate action in the history feed; (2) the pre-market routine has not fired Mon-Fri this week — ADANIPOWER's pullback window flagged on 2026-06-18 may have already resolved (one way or the other) without our checking. Highest-priority fix going into Monday: rebuild UNIVERSE.md and confirm pre-market cron is alive, BEFORE any new entry decision.
