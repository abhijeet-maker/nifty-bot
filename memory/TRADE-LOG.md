# Trade Log

Append-only ledger of every paper trade and every EOD portfolio snapshot.
Day-over-day P&L math depends on the most recent EOD snapshot in this file.

Format has two kinds of entries:
1. **Trade entries** — one per buy/sell. Full thesis + fill details.
2. **EOD snapshots** — one per trading day. Equity + open-positions table.

Nifty 50 closed 23,643.50 (-0.19%), Bank Nifty 25,343.85 (-0.51%) — mildly negative tape; sitting out cost nothing and earned +19 bps of passive alpha. No catalysts taken today. Tomorrow's pre-market routine should re-scan UNIVERSE.md candidates and the earnings calendar; week is fresh (Monday) so full 2-trade budget is intact.
